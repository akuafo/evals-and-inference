# evals-and-inference
This repository is my attempt to start writing more and sharing online.

My initial focus is the external evalauation of LLMs.  This includes libraries, frameworks, and data sets for measuring accuracy, consistency, bias, and alignment.  I'm especially interested the medical domain so I'll go deeper on that.

If I test a new framework, I'll drop my raw notes and findings in here.

If I see a relevant academic paper, I'll read it and write my notes here. 

I'll regularly review those raw notes and write summaries.

I'll try to publish both as longer-form blog posts and articles and short summaries on social media.  Maybe some videos too.
