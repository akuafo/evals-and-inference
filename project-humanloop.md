Human Loops seems like a really interesting framework and platform. The founders are well regarded and it's gotten early adoption from some significant companies. It seems to blend a number of useful features such as a no-code platform for non-technical people to engineer prompts and the ability for technical staff to integrate those into deployment pipelines.

My interest in Human Loop is really around the framework for managing and versioning prompts. I want to understand the capabilities of using that for LLM evaluations.
